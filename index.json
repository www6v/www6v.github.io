Design of Qualitative Research 1.1. The design of Qualitative Research The passage discusses the importance and design of qualitative research. Qualitative research is a well-established field that requires researchers to stay updated with the literature, research publications, conferences, and interest groups in order to keep up with developments. The passage emphasizes the need for researchers to have a genuine interest in their field and a desire to improve their practice, which leads to asking researchable questions and conducting qualitative research.\nThe passage suggests that qualitative research aims to understand problems or topics from the perspectives of the local population involved. It highlights the strength of qualitative research in providing complex textual descriptions of people\u0026rsquo;s experiences, beliefs, emotions, opinions, and social factors. However, it also acknowledges that qualitative research alone may not provide a comprehensive understanding and suggests using it in conjunction with quantitative methods for a better interpretation of complex situations.\nThe passage briefly mentions three common qualitative research methods: participant observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups. Each method is suited for obtaining specific types of data, such as observing behaviors in natural contexts, collecting personal histories and experiences, or exploring cultural norms of a group.\nQualitative data can take various forms, including field notes, audio or video recordings, and transcripts.\n这段文字讨论了定性研究的重要性和设计。定性研究是一个成熟的领域，研究人员需要及时了解文献、研究杂志、兴趣组和会议，以跟上发展的步伐。文章强调研究人员对自己领域的真正兴趣和改进实践的愿望的重要性，这导致提出可研究的问题并进行定性研究。\n文章指出，定性研究旨在从当地人口的角度理解问题或主题。它强调了定性研究在提供人们经验、信念、情感、观点和社会因素等复杂文本描述方面的优势。然而，文章也承认单纯的定性研究可能无法提供全面的理解，建议与定量方法结合使用，以更好地解释复杂情况。\n文章简要提到了三种常见的定性研究方法：参与观察、深度访谈和焦点小组。每种方法都适用于获取特定类型的数据，例如在自然环境中观察行为、收集个人历史和经验，或探索群体的文化规范。\n定性数据可以采用各种形式，包括实地笔记、音频或视频记录和文字转录。\n1.2. Where does Qualitative Research come from? Qualitative research has its roots in the investigations conducted by anthropologists and sociologists, who explored people\u0026rsquo;s lives, social and cultural contexts, and their understanding of the world. These early qualitative studies involved fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of relevant documents. The development of qualitative research was significantly influenced by publications such as \u0026ldquo;The Discovery of Grounded Theory\u0026rdquo; in 1967 and \u0026ldquo;Towards a Methodology of Naturalistic Inquiry in Educational Evaluation\u0026rdquo; in 1978. These works introduced inductive analysis and the concept of naturalistic analysis, respectively. Over time, researchers from various disciplines embraced qualitative methods, leading to the establishment of discipline-specific journals and conferences dedicated to qualitative research. Today, qualitative research is widely disseminated through books, articles, and conferences.\n定性研究源于人类学家和社会学家的调查研究，他们探索人们的生活、社会和文化背景，以及他们对世界的理解。这些早期的定性研究包括实地调查、访谈和相关文件的分析。定性研究的发展受到了一些重要出版物的显著影响，如1967年的《发现有根理论：定性研究策略》和1978年的《教育评估中自然主义调查方法论》。这些作品分别引入了归纳分析和自然主义分析的概念。随着时间的推移，来自不同学科的研究者开始采用定性方法，导致了专业期刊和专门致力于定性研究的会议的建立。如今，定性研究通过书籍、文章和会议广泛传播。\n1.3. Comparing Quantitative and Qualitative Research Quantitative research focuses on confirming hypotheses, using rigid instruments and structured methods to quantify variation, predict causal relationships, and describe population characteristics. It collects numerical data and follows a stable study design. In contrast, qualitative research seeks to explore phenomena, employing flexible instruments and methods to describe and explain relationships, individual experiences, and group norms. It collects textual data through open-ended questions and allows for participant responses to shape the research direction. Qualitative research aims to understand how people interpret their experiences and construct meaning, using words as data.\n定量研究着重于确认假设，采用严格的工具和结构化方法来量化变异、预测因果关系，描述人群特征。它收集数值数据并遵循稳定的研究设计。相反，定性研究旨在探索现象，使用灵活的工具和方法描述和解释关系、个体经验和群体规范。它通过开放式问题收集文本数据，并允许参与者的回答塑造研究方向。定性研究旨在理解人们如何解释他们的经历和构建意义，使用词语作为数据。\n1.4. Characteristics of Qualitative Research 1.4.1. Focus on Meaning and Understanding Qualitative research focuses on understanding the interpretation, construction, and meaning-making of people\u0026rsquo;s experiences. Its primary goal is to comprehend how individuals make sense of their lives and describe their own understanding of their experiences. The emphasis is on capturing the participants\u0026rsquo; perspective, known as the emic or insider\u0026rsquo;s perspective, rather than the researcher\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint, referred to as the etic or outsider\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\n定性研究关注于对人们经历的解释、他们对世界的构建以及他们赋予经历的意义。因此，定性研究的总体目的是理解人们如何理解他们的生活，他们如何构建意义，并描述他们如何解释他们的经历。一些作者（Patton, 1985; Bohannan, 1992）遵循这种思路，提出了包含这种理解观点的定性研究定义。 然而，重要的是要区分参与者的观点与研究者的观点。这通常被称为内部视角（emic）与外部视角（etic）之间的区别。\n1.4.2. Researcher as Primary Instrument In qualitative research, the researcher serves as the primary instrument for data collection and analysis. This allows for immediate response and adaptation, as well as the ability to observe and interpret nonverbal cues. The researcher can also explore unexpected responses and gain a deeper understanding of the participants\u0026rsquo; experiences. However, the subjective nature of human instruments can introduce biases and limitations. It is crucial for researchers to acknowledge and address their own biases, monitoring how they may impact data collection and interpretation. While subjectivity is not the main focus of qualitative studies, researchers should be aware of their potential influences.\n在定性研究中，研究者是数据收集和分析的主要工具。然而，这一特点可能带来积极和消极的影响。首先，由于研究的目标是理解，需要一个能够立即回应和适应的人类工具来收集和分析数据。此外，研究者能够通过关注非语言和语言交流、即时处理信息、澄清和总结材料、检查回答以准确解释，并且能够探索不寻常或意外的回答，从而扩展对研究对象的理解。\n然而，考虑到人类工具的特性，我们会意识到可能存在一些缺点和偏见，这可能会干扰研究结果。这就是任何人类工具的主观性。在这种情况下，重要的是识别和监测这些偏见或“主观性”，以清楚地说明它们可能如何影响数据的收集和解释。尽管主观性不是大多数定性研究的重点，但研究人员需要处理自己潜在的影响。\n1.4.3. An Inductive Process One important characteristic of qualitative research is its inductive process. Qualitative researchers collect data to build concepts, hypotheses, or theories, rather than testing pre-existing hypotheses. They observe and intuitively understand phenomena in the field, allowing theory to emerge from the data. This approach is used when existing theories fail to adequately explain a particular issue or phenomenon.\n定性研究的另一个重要特点是归纳性过程。逻辑上讲，进行研究是因为缺乏能够涵盖问题或现象的理论，或者现有理论未能以适当的方式解释它。因此，定性研究的一个重要特点是过程是归纳性的。这意味着研究者通过收集数据来构建概念、假设或理论，而不是测试假设。这种类型的研究是基于从实地观察和直觉理解中建立理论。当现有理论不能充分解释特定问题或现象时，就会采用这种方法。\n1.4.4. Rich description Qualitative research produces rich descriptions using words and visuals instead of numbers. The results provide detailed descriptions of various aspects related to the research, including the context, participants, and activities. All collected data is typically included to support the study\u0026rsquo;s findings.\n定性研究的结果具有丰富的描述性。研究者使用文字和图像来传达他们对现象的理解，而不是使用数字。结果通常是对研究中涉及的各个方面的描述，包括背景环境、参与者和活动等。研究过程中收集的所有数据通常都会被包括在内，以支持研究的发现。\n1.4.5. Other Characteristics and Competencies Qualitative research is characterized by its emergent and flexible nature, nonrandom and purposeful sample selection, and extensive time spent in the natural setting. Researchers in qualitative studies need to possess competencies such as a high tolerance for ambiguity, careful observation skills, the ability to ask good questions, inductive thinking, and comfort with writing reports. These competencies are essential for effectively conducting qualitative research and presenting the findings in a comprehensive manner.\n定性研究的特点包括其不断涌现和灵活性，非随机和有目的性的样本选择，以及在自然环境中投入大量时间。定性研究的研究者需要具备一定的能力，如对模糊性的高容忍度，细致的观察技巧，善于提出问题，归纳思维能力和撰写报告的能力。这些能力对于有效进行定性研究并以全面的方式呈现研究结果至关重要。\n1.5. Six Common Qualitative Research Designs There are various approaches and designs within qualitative research, with authors proposing different classifications. Six common qualitative research designs include basic qualitative research, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, narrative analysis, and qualitative case study. These designs share common attributes but have distinct focuses and variations in research question formulation, sample selection, data collection and analysis, and reporting. Researchers may also combine multiple designs, such as in an ethnographic case study.\n在定性研究中，存在着各种不同的方法和设计，不同的作者提出了不同的分类方式。其中六种常见的定性研究设计包括基础定性研究、现象学、扎根理论、民族志学、叙事分析和定性案例研究。这些设计具有共同的特点，但在研究问题的制定、样本选择、数据收集和分析以及报告方面存在着不同的重点和变化。研究者也可以结合多种设计，例如在民族志案例研究中。\n1.5.1. Basic Qualitative Research Basic qualitative research is the most common type of qualitative research in applied fields such as education, administration, health, social work, counseling, and business. It is characterized by a constructivist approach, where researchers aim to understand the meaning a phenomenon holds for those involved in it. The focus is on how individuals interpret their experiences, construct their world, and attribute meaning to their experiences. Data collection methods include interviews, observations, and document analysis. The analysis involves identifying recurrent patterns in the data, and the interpretation is based on the researcher\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the participants\u0026rsquo; perspectives. The main goal of basic qualitative research is to uncover and interpret the constructed meanings of individuals\u0026rsquo; lives and worlds.\n在教育、行政管理、健康、社会工作、咨询和商业等应用领域，基础定性研究是最常见的定性研究类型。它以建构主义方法为特点，研究人员旨在理解现象对相关参与者的意义。研究关注个体如何解释他们的经历、构建他们的世界，并赋予经历以意义。数据收集方法包括访谈、观察和文件分析。分析过程涉及识别数据中的重复模式，并根据研究人员对参与者观点的理解进行解释。基础定性研究的主要目标是揭示和解释个体生活和世界中构建的意义。\n1.5.2. Phenomenology Phenomenology is a philosophy that underlies qualitative research, focusing on the experience itself and how it transforms into consciousness. It is interested in our \u0026ldquo;lived experience\u0026rdquo; rather than categorizing and simplifying phenomena. Phenomenological research is based on the assumption that there is an essence to shared experiences. The key task of a phenomenologist is to depict the essence or basic structure of a phenomenon, suspending prior beliefs to avoid interference. The study begins with a phenomenological interview, with the researcher exploring their own experiences to become aware of personal biases. The process of epoche, or refraining from judgment, is commonly undertaken by researchers. Other strategies unique to phenomenological research include phenomenological reduction, horizontalization, and imaginative variation. The end product is a composite description presenting the \u0026rsquo;essence\u0026rsquo; of the phenomenon. There are variations in how a phenomenological study is conducted.\n现象学是一种哲学，它是定性研究的基础，关注的是经验本身以及它如何转化为意识。它对我们的\u0026quot;生活经验\u0026quot;感兴趣，而不是对现象进行分类和简化。现象学研究基于一个假设，即共享经验有其本质。现象学家的主要任务是描绘现象的本质或基本结构，暂停先前的信念以避免干扰。研究开始于现象学访谈，研究者探索自己的经验以意识到个人偏见。研究者通常会进行的过程包括epoche，即避免判断。现象学研究的其他独特策略包括现象学还原，横向化和想象变化。最终的产品是呈现现象\u0026rsquo;本质\u0026rsquo;的综合描述。现象学研究的进行方式有多种变化。\n1.5.3. Ethnography Ethnography is a qualitative research method that has been used for a long time. It involves studying human society and culture by immersing oneself in the group being studied. Ethnographers spend a significant amount of time with the group, participating in their activities and building relationships with informants. The primary method of data collection is through participant observation, interviews, and analysis of documents and artifacts. Ethnography focuses on providing a thick description of the culture and interpreting the meanings participants attribute to their lives. It distinguishes between the emic perspective of insiders and the etic perspective of researchers. Ethnography is the second most common type of qualitative study and requires a clear understanding of the sociocultural patterns of the group under study.\n民族志学是一种长期以来被广泛应用的定性研究方法。它涉及通过深入研究的群体中融入自身，来研究人类社会和文化。民族志学家与研究对象共度大量时间，参与他们的活动并与知情者建立关系。数据收集的主要方法包括参与观察、访谈以及文献和文物的分析。民族志学着重提供对文化的详细描述，并解释参与者赋予其生活的意义。它区分了内部人的emic视角和研究者的etic视角。民族志学是第二常见的定性研究类型，需要对研究对象所在群体的社会文化模式有清晰的理解。\n1.5.4. Grounded Theory Grounded Theory is a qualitative research method focused on building theory from the data. It was introduced by Glaser and Strauss in 1967. Unlike other qualitative approaches, the emphasis is on developing substantive theories that are specific to everyday situations. Grounded Theory is particularly useful for studying processes and how things change over time. Data collection involves interviews, observations, and analysis of various documentary materials. The process includes theoretical sampling and constant comparative analysis to identify patterns and develop categories. The ultimate goal is to create a grounded theory that explains the relationships among categories, properties, and hypotheses. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the term \u0026ldquo;grounded theory\u0026rdquo; is sometimes used loosely, causing confusion. A study should be labeled as a \u0026ldquo;grounded theory study\u0026rdquo; only when a substantive theory is derived from the data.\n“基础理论（Grounded Theory）”是一种定性研究方法，其重点是从数据中建立理论。它由格拉泽（Glaser）和斯特劳斯（Strauss）于1967年提出。与其他定性方法不同，基础理论的重点是发展与日常情境相关的实质性理论。基础理论特别适用于研究过程以及事物随时间变化的情况。数据收集包括访谈、观察和各种文献资料的分析。研究过程包括理论抽样和不断比较分析，以确定模式并发展出类别。最终目标是创建一个基础理论，解释类别、属性和假设之间的关系。需要注意的是，“基础理论”这个术语有时使用不严谨，容易引起混淆。只有在从数据中得出实质性理论时，研究才应被标为“基础理论研究”。\n1.5.5. Narrative Inquiry Narrative Inquiry is a qualitative research method that focuses on using stories as data to understand human experiences and make sense of the world. Stories and narratives are fundamental to communication and sense-making. In this approach, first-person accounts of experiences, told in a story format with a beginning, middle, and end, serve as the primary data. Various terms like biography, life history, oral history, autoethnography, and autobiography may be used interchangeably with narratives. Hermeneutics, the study of interpretation, plays a crucial role in narrative inquiry, as it guides how texts are understood and interpreted within their historical and cultural contexts. Narrative analysis draws from hermeneutics and extends its scope to include interview transcripts, life history narratives, historical memoirs, and creative nonfiction. Different methodological approaches are employed to analyze stories in narrative inquiry, such as biographical analysis, psychological analysis focusing on personal issues and motivations, and linguistic (discourse) analysis examining language use, narrative structure, and nonverbal elements like intonation and pauses. Alongside the increasing popularity of narrative inquiry, questions arise regarding the best practices for presenting people\u0026rsquo;s stories, the researcher\u0026rsquo;s role in the process, and the validity and reliability of these narratives as sources of knowledge.\n叙事研究是一种定性研究方法，专注于将故事作为数据来理解人类经历和认识世界。故事和叙述对于沟通和理解至关重要。在这种方法中，以开始、中间和结尾的故事形式讲述的个人经历成为主要数据。可以互换使用多种术语，如传记、生活史、口述历史、自传和自传体文学。 解释学，即解释研究，在叙事研究中起着至关重要的作用，它指导如何在历史和文化背景中理解和解释文本。叙事分析借鉴了解释学，并扩展了其范围，包括访谈记录、生活史叙述、历史回忆录和创意非虚构作品。 在叙事研究中，采用不同的方法论方法来分析故事，例如传记分析、关注个人问题和动机的心理分析，以及语言（话语）分析，研究语言使用、叙事结构和语言之外的元素，如语调和停顿。 随着叙事研究日益受到欢迎，人们对于如何最好地呈现人们的故事、研究者在过程中的角色以及这些叙述作为知识来源的有效性和可靠性等问题也逐渐浮现。\n1.5.6. Qualitative Case Study Qualitative case study is a unique form of qualitative research that involves in-depth description and analysis of a bounded system. It shares common characteristics with other qualitative research methods, such as the search for meaning and understanding, the researcher as the primary instrument, an inductive investigative approach, and richly descriptive outcomes. The defining characteristic of a case study is the delimitation of the object of study, known as the case, which can be an individual, program, group, institution, community, or policy. Unlike other qualitative research methods, the unit of analysis, rather than the topic of investigation, characterizes a case study. The focus is on a specific sample or bounded system, rather than the entire population. It is essential to establish boundaries and have a clearly defined sample for a study to be considered a case study. Comparative case studies, involving multiple cases or subunits, are also commonly conducted. Overall, qualitative case study research offers a distinct approach to understanding and analyzing bounded systems, emphasizing depth and specificity in the investigation.\n定性案例研究是一种独特的定性研究形式，涉及对有界系统的深入描述和分析。它与其他定性研究方法有共同的特点，如寻求意义和理解，研究者作为主要工具，归纳性的调查方法，以及丰富的描述性结果。案例研究的定义特征是对研究对象的限定，也就是案例，可以是个人、程序、团体、机构、社区或政策。 与其他定性研究方法不同，案例研究的特点是分析单位，而不是调查主题。焦点在于特定的样本或有界系统，而不是整个人口。一个研究要被视为案例研究，就必须建立边界并有一个明确定义的样本。比较案例研究，涉及多个案例或子单位，也常常被进行。 总的来说，定性案例研究提供了一种独特的方法来理解和分析有界系统，强调调查的深度和特异性。\n","permalink":"https://www6v.github.io/posts/phd/phdqualitativeresearch/","summary":"Qualitative Research 定性研究","title":"Qualitative Research 定性研究"},{"content":"Vim 跳转到行首的命令是 0，跳转到行尾的命令是 $\nvi 兼容的 gg 和 G 跳转到开头和结尾行\nd 加动作来进行删除(dd 删除整行);D 则相当于 d$，删除到行尾。\nc 加动作来进行修改(cc 修改整行);C 则相当于 c$，删除到行尾然后进入插入模 式。\ni 在当前字符前面进入插入模式;I 则相当于 ^i，把光标移到行首非空白字符上然后进 入插入模式。\u2028a 在当前字符后面进入插入模式;A 相当于 $a，把光标移到行尾然后进入插入模式。\nr 替换光标下的字符;R 则进入替换模式，每次按键(直到 )替换一个字符\nu 撤销最近的一个修改动作;U 撤销当前行上的所有修改。\n","permalink":"https://www6v.github.io/posts/devtools/vim/","summary":"vim","title":"vim"},{"content":"PH.D Certificate PH.D Offer ","permalink":"https://www6v.github.io/posts/phd/phdoffer/","summary":"Ph.D. Offer","title":"Ph.D. Offer"},{"content":"导入包,自动修正 Alt+Enter\n用@来围绕选中的代码行[@ 包括if、while、try catch等] Ctrl + Alt + T\n回到上一步 ctrl + alt + \u0026lt;- , alt + \u0026lt;-\n回到下一步 ctrl + alt + -\u0026gt; , alt + -\u0026gt;\n跳转到定义处 Ctrl + B\n跳转到方法实现处 Ctrl + Alt + B\n快速打开文件 Ctrl + N（Ctrl+Shift+N）\n根据模板格式化选择的代码 Ctrl + Alt + L\n选择光标所在字符处的单词 Ctrl + W\n在方法间快速移动 Alt+Up and Alt+Down\n跳转到上次编辑的地方 Ctrl+Shift+Backspace\n显示最近编辑的文件列表 Ctrl+E\n注释/反注释 Ctrl + /\n","permalink":"https://www6v.github.io/posts/devtools/ideashortcut/","summary":"IDEA 快捷键","title":"IDEA 快捷键"},{"content":"笔记[1] 康奈尔笔记法\n最上 题目 最左 提炼 最右 筛选-ppt,版书,书上(索引) 最下 链接 筛选 -\u0026gt; 提炼 -\u0026gt; 链接 东京大学笔记法 最右 - 注重总结\n麦肯锡笔记法[适合职场] 按照「空-雨-伞」三步执行\n埃森哲 pointsheet[适合职场]\n方格笔记法 高桥政史 《聪明人用方格笔记本》\n子弹笔记法 符号+事情=子弹\n微信传输助手+讯飞语音输入\n思维导图 学习方法 【英国学霸】其实你不是笨：如何学好重难点知识与科目？！\n参考 非常实用的笔记方法 ","permalink":"https://www6v.github.io/posts/study/studymethod/","summary":"学习方法","title":"学习方法"},{"content":"口语-连续 连读 Linking 辅+元 常规 不送气 flap t, 闪音 Insertion 元+元 拖长 略读 Gemination 辅+辅 /t/ + /d/ , 浊辅音 + 清辅音 吞音 Gemination 辅+辅 Glottal stop[仅作了解，听懂就可以] 略读 [常见] H-dropping G-dropping 变音 Fusion 同化 弱读[常见], 缩写, 其他 参考: 【合集完结】【最全英语连读规则】英语听力口语发音提高秘诀 ***\n口语-音标 类型 K.K. 美式 DJ KK美式英语音标（发音口型教学） *** 【纯正英式发音】这是BBC出品的到现在为止最棒的英语发音教程（完整版） ***\n口语-语调 3个部分 Tonality 调群切分 Tonicity 调核位置 Tone 语调模式 参考: bili\n","permalink":"https://www6v.github.io/posts/english/englishoral/","summary":"English-Oral[basic]","title":"English-Oral[basic]"},{"content":"常用句型[1] Where can i\u0026hellip;?\nCould you tell me\u0026hellip;?\nWhen shall we\u0026hellip;?\nHow much\u0026hellip;?\nWhat is the best way to\u0026hellip;?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very nice of you to\u0026hellip;\nBelieve me, \u0026hellip;.\nI am sorry, but I\u0026hellip;\ni\u0026rsquo;m determined to\u0026hellip;\nI can\u0026rsquo;t imagine\u0026hellip;\nIn my opinion,\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip; is one of the most\u0026hellip;\n因果 I wonder if you\u0026hellip; That\u0026rsquo;s why\u0026hellip; How come you\u0026hellip;?

I would speak to the person with whom the conflict was with, to ascertain the cause of it before suggesting a way forward that we were both comfortable with. I am confident that we could sort out our differences and move forward quickly. Q7 Tell me about a time when you were under pressure at work. What was the situation, and how did you get through? 场景：It was Friday afternoon, and my manager came into the office to ask for a volunteer to put together some company sales figures which they needed urgently for a meeting at 4 pm. I put my hand up and volunteered to do the job for my manager. 任务：It was my responsibility to put together 3 years\u0026rsquo; worth of historical company sales figures based on product type, serial number and the total sales generated. I literally had three hours to complete the task, so I set to work immediately. 行动：To make sure I completed the task on time and to the right standard, I created a spreadsheet with three columns and i then worked through each product meticulously, cross-checking as I went. 欢天喜地大结局：I only stopped for a short break once and by the time 4 pm had come along I had presented the figures to my manager. I enjoy working under pressure and my ability to remain calm and work meticulously is an advantage in situations like this. Q9 What did you like and dislike about your last job? （回答策略：先扬后抑，避重就轻，借力打力） There were many things I liked such as the team I was a part of and how we all pulled together to get things done during tasks and projects. I enjoyed the supportive working environment and the fact my manager was prepared to send people on training and development courses to ensure we all had the right skills and qualities needed to do our jobs properly. I also like the fact my manager wasn\u0026rsquo;t afraid to say when she thought we could have done something better. This always ensured we all progressed both as individuals and as part of a team. The only thing that slightly frustrated me about my last job is I did not feel we were ambitious enough in moving forward as a company. We were successful, but I felt we could have achieved many more things, especially if we had embraced digital technology and the advertising opportunities that come with it. Q12 Tell me about a time you took the initiative to solve a difficult problem. 场景：A supplier contacted our company one day to explain a product they had been supplying us with was no longer available. This was a major problem because we already had several orders from customers who were waiting on this product. 任务：I saw it as my responsibility to use my initiative to find an alternative supplier who could supply the product moving forward. 行动： So I started researching online alternative suppliers. I looked at their business history, their reviews, and their online company accounts to make sure they were reliable and trustworthy. I then drew up a shortlist of three companies and I contacted all of them to obtain quotes to suppliers with this product. 永远积极正向的结果：After speaking to all three companies, I chose the one that could provide the best value for money and that could also quickly supply us with the product so the customers who had already ordered the product were not left waiting. Q16 Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was different from yours. 场景创设：In my previous role a new member of our team joined the organization and I volunteered to help them settle into the role and to teach them how to carry out their duties to the correct standard. She was very nervous and shy, and when I spoke to her, it was clear that English was not her first language. 任务：It was my responsibility to welcome her to the team, to help make her feel valued, and to ascertain her level of skill so i could put a plan of action in place to train her. 采取的行动：Because of her shy personality, I wanted to encourage her to have more confidence in her abilities. It was clear she was going to be good at her job, but I just needed to help her get over the initial anxiety of joining a new team that she was unfamiliar with. By introducing her to all team members, and by being patient with her whilst going through company procedures and training, her confidence levels started to improve dramatically. 永远的欢天喜地大结局：Within two weeks of joining, she was a fully trained up and confident member of the team who everyone valued. Q17 Describe a time when the team you were a part of was undergoing some change. How did the change impact you, and how do you adapt? In my previous job, a new manager came into the team and she wanted to make big changes to the way that we operated. This was a big thing for the team because the previous manager had not changed anything for many years. I was quite excited about the change because I felt there were some things we could improve on. The change impacted me because I had to learn new skills and duties. Some members of the team were negative about the change, but I encouraged them to view it more positively and to see it as an opportunity for personal growth. I adapted by being supportive of the change, by viewing it positively and by doing all I could to learn the new duties quickly and diligently. Change is a good thing and if you embrace it positive things can happen. Q22 Describe yourself in three words. I would describe myself as loyal, self-motivated, and commercially-aware. Being a loyal employee means you can trust me to do a good job and to always be a good role model for your company. Being self-motivated means, you will never have to pick me up for not doing my job properly either on time or to the necessary standard. And being commercially aware means that I respect the fact that the only way your business will thrive is if people like me do a good job for your company, and I also seek to improve and develop year on year. What contribution did you make to your current (previous) organization？ I have finished three new projects, and I am sure I can apply my experience to this position.\nWhat do you think you are worth to us？ I feel I can make some positive contributions to your company in the future.\nWhat make you think you would be a success in this position？ My long-term work experience should qualify me for this particular job.
